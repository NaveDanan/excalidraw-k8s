- [x] Create NetworkPolicy template
- [x] Create ServiceAccount template
- [x] Create helper templates

#### 2. Kubernetes Manifests âœ… COMPLETED
**Reminder**: All components must be fully connected in the K8s cluster
- [x] Deployment manifest for Excalidraw app
- [x] Service manifest for internal communication
- [x] Ingress manifest for external access
- [x] ConfigMap for application configuration
- [x] HorizontalPodAutoscaler for scaling

**Reminder**: Ensure the app works properly in K8s environment
- [x] Environment-specific configurations (dev/prod values)
- [x] Resource limits and requests
- [x] Health checks and probes
- [x] Security contexts and policies

#### 4. Networking and Connectivity âœ… COMPLETED
**Reminder**: Components must be fully connected
- [x] Internal service discovery
- [x] External ingress configuration
- [x] SSL/TLS termination configuration
- [x] CORS and security headers
- [x] Network policies for isolation

#### 5. Monitoring and Observability âœ… COMPLETED
**Reminder**: Production-ready K8s deployment needs monitoring
- [x] Liveness and readiness probes
- [x] Metrics collection annotations
- [x] Logging configuration
- [x] Health check endpoints

#### 6. Documentation and Deployment âœ… COMPLETED
**Reminder**: Make deployment straightforward for K8s clusters
- [x] Helm installation instructions
- [x] kubectl deployment instructions
- [x] Configuration guide
- [x] Troubleshooting guide
- [x] Production deployment checklist
- [x] Security best practices guide

## Technical Notes

### Application Architecture Analysis
- **Frontend**: React app built with Vite, served by nginx
- **Port**: Application runs on port 80 in container
- **Build Process**: Uses yarn build:app:docker for container builds
- **Dependencies**: Node.js 18-22, nginx 1.27-alpine for serving

### Kubernetes Requirements
- **Container Registry**: Need to specify image registry
- **Storage**: Static files only, no persistent storage needed
- **Networking**: HTTP/HTTPS ingress required
- **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling possible (stateless app)
- **Resources**: Lightweight React app, minimal resource requirements

### Security Considerations
- **Image Security**: Using nginx:1.27-alpine (minimal attack surface)
- **Runtime**: Non-root user in nginx container
- **Network Policies**: Consider implementing for production
- **RBAC**: Minimal permissions needed

## Next Steps - Implementation and Testing
1. âœ… Create comprehensive Helm chart with all necessary templates
2. âœ… Configure proper resource limits and health checks
3. âœ… Set up ingress with SSL termination
4. ðŸ”„ Test deployment in local K8s cluster (minikube/kind)
5. ðŸ”„ Test deployment in cloud K8s cluster
6. âœ… Document deployment and configuration process
7. ðŸ”„ Performance testing and optimization
8. ðŸ”„ Security validation and penetration testing
